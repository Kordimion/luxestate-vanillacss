# Luxestate web page template

psd design can be found here: https://www.graphberry.com/item/luxestate--real-estate-landing-page

I've decided to code this without using bootstrap, as I usually do. It came out being worse than I expected. I really need to practice more vanilla css.

Even though this project is incomplete, I will anyway push it to the GitHub. I want to finish it later.



### Key lessons from this project

- I did not realize how useful Sass is until I made this. Even 600 lines of css code is hard to maintain, because of absense of component nesting. It would be nice to hide all code in editor for all components, and show it only when you need to edit it. 

  But in css you have to use comments and search option in code editor to find components that you need. It is not only uncomfortable, but it also affects code quality.

- I need to learn how svg works, because when I tried to make that arrow in the template, I failed and used font awesome one instead.

- Frontend css frameworks are awesome, use them more in typical landing pages like that. Otherwise it will take you lots of time writing typical component.

- I need to learn how to use animations in web design, because right now this landing page looks unattractive.

- Optimize images, or your website will be very slow and laggy.



### Things to upgrade in this template: 

- adaptivity for mobile devices
- lazy loading images
- make website look alive using animations 
- create custom iconset
- set gulp for optimizing everything
